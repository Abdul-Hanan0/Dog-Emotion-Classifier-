🐶 Dog Emotion Classifier – Introduction

Understanding a dog’s emotions can make a huge difference in how we care for and connect with our furry companions. This project aims to classify the emotional state of dogs such as happy, sad, angry, or relaxed just by analyzing images of their faces.

We trained a deep learning model using the EfficientNet architecture to recognize subtle facial cues in dogs. The idea is simple but powerful: a smart tool that can interpret a dog's emotions from images, just like humans read each other’s expressions.

🔷 Why it matters

Pet Owners can better understand their dogs’ moods and respond accordingly.

Veterinarians might use it as an early indicator of stress, pain, or discomfort.

Smart Devices for pets can be enhanced with emotional feedback.

Animal Researchers can use it for behavioral analysis at scale.


🔷 About the Dataset

The dataset was sourced from ---, containing labeled images of dogs in different emotional states. Each image is tagged with one of the four emotions: happy, sad, angry, or relaxed. The dataset includes a diverse range of breeds and lighting conditions to help build a robust model.
